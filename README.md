This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Supabase Media Storage

To render media in posts:

1. Create a public bucket named `media` in Supabase Storage.
2. Upload files under `posts/<postId>/...`.
3. In the `posts` table, add the media block(s) with `storageKey` pointing to the uploaded file path.

Example `media` value:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "image",
    "bucket": "media",
    "storageKey": "posts/<postId>/hero.jpg",
    "caption": "Optional caption",
    "order": 1
  }
]
```

We will add an upload admin UI later; for now this is manual.
